# Communication Plan

We text on Messenger daily, meet in person or call twice a week.

# Rules

1. Be responsible: If you can’t finish a task on time, tell the group at least a day early.
2. Show up: Join every meeting or tell the group if you can’t come.
3. Communicate clearly: Use one main chat (Messenger) so no one misses updates.
4. Respect each other: No interrupting, no attitude, no blaming. Keep it civil even if someone’s code explodes.
5. Stay active: Everyone should contribute something each week 
6. Be honest: If you don’t understand something, ask.
7. Support each other: If someone’s struggling, help them out.
8. Decision-making: Majority vote wins.

# Conflict plan

If someone disappears or disagrees - 
    1. If they don’t reply in like 2–3 days, another teammate tells the instructor.
    2. The rest of the team keeps working, splitting their tasks if needed.
	3. When they come back, they catch up and finish their missed parts.

If you disagree - You talk it out respectfully in the group chat or a quick call.
