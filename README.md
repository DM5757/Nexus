# ðŸ§­ Nexus â€” Smart Student Deals & Hangout Finder

**Course:** Building AI-Powered Applications  
**Team Name:** Nexus  
**Date:** October 2025

## ðŸ’¡ Project Overview

Nexus helps university students easily discover verified student discounts, hangout spots, and study-friendly locations â€” all personalized to their mood, budget, and interests.

Students often miss out on deals scattered across multiple sources (like TBC or BOG student cards, social media, or campus pages). Nexus brings everything into one place and uses AI-based recommendations to match students with the best options around them.

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Goals

- Collect and display verified student deals from banks, universities, and local businesses
- Recommend locations based on user mood, time, and budget
- Provide an intuitive, student-friendly interface for daily use
- Use free and ethical AI tools (no paid APIs, no private data)
